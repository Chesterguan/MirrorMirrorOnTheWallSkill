## Magic Mirror

Repo: [MagicMirror](https://github.com/MichMich/MagicMirror)

We are using an open source MagicMirrorÂ² software platform that will allow you to convert your hallway or bathroom mirror into your personal assistant.

### Installation
1. Open your command line

2. Download the repository to your laptop

`git clone https://github.com/MichMich/MagicMirror.git`

3. Enter the repository

`cd MagicMirror/`

4. Install node libraries

`npm install`

5. Navigate to the config folder and rename config.js.sample to config.js

`cd config/`

`mv config.js.sample config.js`

6. Run the app

`npm start`



## AWS IoT Core

You need to setup an AWS IoT Device, which is used for the communication between this Alexa skill and the Magic Mirror node app. The credentials you obtained through this process will also be used by the complementary Magic Mirror Module.

  1. Login to __[AWS Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/console/home?region=us-east-1)__

## Alexa Skill
An [AWS Lambda](http://aws.amazon.com/lambda) function of an Alexa skill for communicating and controlling a [MagicMirror](https://github.com/MichMich/MagicMirror) using AWS IoT Device Gateway.


# It is complementary to the Magic Mirror Module [Mirror Mirror On The Wall](https://github.com/joanaz/MMM-MirrorMirrorOnTheWall).


Please follow the steps below to setup and install this Alexa skill correctly.


## 4. Configure an Alexa Skill to Use Lambda

  1. Go to the [Alexa Console](https://developer.amazon.com/edw/home.html) and click on __Alexa Skills Kit__
  ![](Screenshots/2.20-ASK.png)

  1. Click on the __Create Skill__ button.
  ![](Screenshots/2.21-Create.png)

  1. Set "Mirror Mirror On The Wall" as the skill name and click the __Create a skill__ button.
  ![](Screenshots/2.22-CreateSkill.png)

  1. Set "mirror mirror on the wall" as the invocation name. This is what is used to activate your skill.
  ![](Screenshots/2.24-Invocation.png)

  1. Copy the __Interaction Model__ from the included InteractionModel.json in the speechAssets folder.
  ![](Screenshots/2.25-Intents.png)

  1. Select the __AWS Lambda ARN__ for the skill Endpoint and paste the ARN copied from Section 3 Step 8. Click __Save Endpoints__.
  ![](Screenshots/2.28-SavedEndpoint.png)

  1. Click __Build Model__ on the main page if not already built.
  ![](Screenshots/2.29-Build.png)

  1. You can test your Alexa skill by entering invoking it in the Test tab.
  ![](Screenshots/2.30-Test.png)

  1. Click __Your Skills__ at the top. In the skills list, click __View Skill ID__ under MirrorMirrorOnTheWall and copy it.
  ![](Screenshots/2.31-SkillID.png)

  1. Paste the Application Id into the index.js file for the variable __APP_ID__, and save the change

  1. Delete the zip file generated in Section 3 Step 1, and generate a new zip file using the same method. Upload the new zip file to Lambda. This step makes sure the Lambda function only serves request from an authorized source.
  
  


## AWS Lambda

### Prepare code

## 2. Install Dependencies

Dependencies are installed by navigating to your __src__ directory on command line, and enter `npm install`.

- [alexa-sdk](https://github.com/alexa/alexa-skills-kit-sdk-for-nodejs) (installed via `npm install`)
- [aws-iot-device-sdk](https://github.com/aws/aws-iot-device-sdk-js) (installed via `npm install`)
- [Google Images Search](https://www.npmjs.com/package/google-images) (installed via `npm install`). Follow the instructions in the link to create your own Google Custom Search Engine, and save the CSE ID and API key in __certs/keys.json__ (see keys_sample.json below).
- [Youtube API](https://www.npmjs.com/package/youtube-node)(installed via `npm install`). Watch this [instruction video](https://youtu.be/Im69kzhpR3I) to create your own Youtube API key, and save it in __certs/keys.json__ (see keys_sample.json below).

### 2.1 keys_sample.json

On your command line, navigate to the __certs__ folder, then enter `cp keys_sample.json keys.json`, which will create a copy of keys_sample.json called keys.json. Copy and paste your API keys obtained above in __keys.json__.

```javascript
// keys_sample.json
{
    "cse": {
        "ID": "YOUR GOOGLE CUSTOM SEARCH ENGINE ID",
        "API_key": "YOUR GOOGLE PROJECT API KEY"
    },
    "youtube": {
        "API_key": "YOUR YOUTUBE API KEY"
    }
}
```

### Deploy
  1. Go inside your local __src__ directory, select all files and folders and then create a zip file, make sure the zip file does not contain the src directory itself, otherwise Lambda function will not work.

  ![](https://github.com/joanaz/MirrorMirrorOnTheWallSkill/raw/screenshots/screenshots/ScreenShot2017-02-24at11.23.28.png)

  1. Go to the __[AWS Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/console/home?region=us-east-1)__ and click on the __Lambda__ link. Note: ensure you are in __us-east__ region or you won't be able to use Alexa with Lambda.
  ![](Screenshots/2.11-Lambda.png)

  1. Click on the __Create a Function__ button.
  ![](Screenshots/2.12-CreateFun.png)

  1. Choose __Author from scratch__. Name the function (any name is fine). Keep the Handler as index.handler (this refers to the index.js file in the zip). __Create new role from template__ and name it anything. Click on the __Create function__ button.
  ![](Screenshots/2.13-createFun.png)
  ![](Screenshots/2.13-role.png)

  1. Choose trigger __Alexa Skills Kit__ from the left. Disable Skill ID Verification. Click __Add__. Then scroll up and click __Save__.

  ![](Screenshots/2.15-ASK.png)
  ![](Screenshots/2.16-Triggers.png)
  ![](Screenshots/2.17-Save.png)

  1. With your Lambda function selected, select __Code entry type__ as "Upload a .ZIP file"
  ![](Screenshots/2.18-UploadCode.png)

  1. Click on __Upload__ button, then upload the zip file created in Step 1 to Lambda. Then __Save__.
  ![](Screenshots/2.19-Save.png)

  1. Copy the __ARN__ from the top right to be used later in the Alexa Skill Setup



You are now able to start testing your Alexa skill! You should be able to go to the [Amazon Alexa website](http://alexa.amazon.com/spa/index.html#skills/your-skills/?ref-suffix=ysa_gw) and see your skill enabled.
